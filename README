README

I own a tennis podcast named twiner_podcast. I want to automate the Instagram posting to let the podcast grow. The more regularly we post, the more we should grow...

The code needs to: 

- Search for tennis news, and summarize it in a few sentences;
- Fill an Instagram post template without formatting issues; 
- Connect to the Instagram API and post automatically (say, every 3-4 days).
